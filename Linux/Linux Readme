The two shell scripts were used as part of a project that required the students to build a shell script that would allow the user to input arguments against a data set.

The output for roulette_dealer_finder_by_time.sh will be the name of the roulette dealer when the user supplies two arguments.  
Time with AM/PM and the date in four digit format
Argument 1 in string  example '08:00:00 AM'
Argument 2 as integer 0310

The output for roulette_dealer_finder_by_time_and_game.sh will be the time and name of the dealer
The script requires 3 arguments  
Argument 1 pulls the date and AM PM as string example for syntax is '01:00:00 PM' 
Argument 2 is the four digit number for the  date of the file example  0310
Argument 3  you will need to provide the column number for the game $2, $3 or $4
